<h3>Mentoring DRC VEX IQ</h3>
</header>
<p>
One of the primary ways we support our Outreach program is through the mentoring of our VEX IQ students, and the 
basis we give them through our experience. We try and provide them with the resources and foundation they require 
in order to succeed once they reach the EDR stage. To do this, we not only help them understand their challenge
objective, but we guide them step by step on how to reach there so they have a strong foundation of the Design 
Process, and a stronger understanding of Robotics as they advance stages. We also help with instructional basis, and 
through teaching them documentation, where they record their design process in the engineering notebook.

<h3>Hosting Competitions</h3>
</header>
<p>
The Dublin Robotics Club is the host of multiple VEX EDR AND VEX IQ tournaments throughout the course of a 
calendar year, where teams from throughout the bay area, mostly, travel to Dublin in order to participate. This 
not only gives us the chance to meet people and mingle, but a chance to build a strong platform socially and 
for the future of our club. We often feature in the newspaper of many schools, showing the excellence of our 
participants.

<h3>Worldwide foundation</h3>
</header>
<p>
Each year, some of our students travel places worldwide in order to spread their knowledge and passion 
for robotics. Our club not only wants to be known for our success in competitions, but we also want 
the less fortunate to lay their hands on what we do, and take up the same interests, so that one day they 
have the same oppurtunity we did in order to take up a course like Mechanical Engineering, or computer 
sciences. 
</p>
<p>
This year, Arya, from 3303D, traveled to India in order to spread the passion of robotics. He took them 
through the design process, and talked about some of the implications, background, end experience you 
might need to be successful in this major. This works as a major inspiration for the rest of us, as not 
only is he laying a foundation for our club, but he is providing the basis of success for the less 
fortunate.

<h3>Donations</h3>
</header>
<p>
Although this is still a work in progress, we are trying to donate to the shelterless, and the homeless 
in order to provide them with a new oppurtunity. This can be food, money, or anything they are in immediate
need of. Although this is not in relations with robotics, we are trying to increase our social range, and 
by doing so we implement the idea of charity, and helping out the less unfortunate. This may not relate 
to our primary purpose, but being good citizens and somaritans are vital in order to strengthen our morales. 
In addition to helping the less unfortunate, we are also going to donate food, clothes, and money to 
Refugee families, so that we can pay back the people that once served our country, and are constantly 
making this world a better place.
