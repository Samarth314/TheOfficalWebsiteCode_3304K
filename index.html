		<h3>Most Recent Tray Bot</h3>
	</header>
	<p>This is a video of our most recent design, which has gone through several minor changes in order to stack more efficiently, effectively,
	and requiring less time. Not only was this developed through mechanical changes, but driving practice certainly played a role in bringing 
	us to this stage.

	<h2>Previous Tournaments</h2>
	</header>
	<ul class="dates">
	<li>
	<span class="date">Sep <strong>12</strong></span>
	<h3><a href="#">Dougherty Valley High School VEX Robotics Tournament</a></h3>
	<p>The Dougherty Valley High School Tournament was our first tournament, and it was a great learning experience. We finished in 
	the Round of 16 at this tournament, and there were several problems we had to fix. Firstly, our robot was constantly disconnecting
	during critical moments. Secondly, our intake wasn't efficient, and worked very on and off. Lastly, our tray was making a machine
	gun type noise, when deploying cubes in the scoring zone, due to the metal meshing against the gears. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="date">Oct <strong>6</strong></span>
<h3><a href="#">Second Tournament in Milpitas</a></h3>
<p>This tournament was a bit of a faliure, as not only did we rank as one of the bottom most teams after qualifiers, but we didn't 
qualify for the playoffs at all. This was primarily because our last minute changes had prohibited our intake from moving, and 
our deploying mechanism was stuck. All we had for most of this competition was a drivetrain, and we suspected that the heavyweight 
of 9 cubes was too much for one motor operating on our tray mechanism. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="date">Oct <strong>26</strong></span>
<h3><a href="#">First League Tournament in Stockton</a></h3>
<p>This was by far our best performance thus far in the year, as we went 4-1, scoring a maximum of 48 points. We were very 
proud of our performance, but we knew that our driver practice was lackluster. Our intake was working efficiently, and our tray 
was moving up and down without any problems, so we were glad that problem was solved. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="date">Nov <strong>16</strong></span>
<h3><a href="#">Our Second League Tournament in Stockton</a></h3>
<p>Our primary driver couldn't make it to this competition, and we had last minute crams for backup driver driving practice, which 
we should've practiced beforehand. We went 3-2 in this competition, and our intake was not at full strength. During the full 
course of our 5 matches, our tray could only intake a maximum of 7 cubes, and it struggled to deploy all the way. After our final 
match, we found out that there was a small piece at the bottom of the tray, obstructing more cubes from entering. 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="date">Jan <strong>10</strong></span>
<h3><a href="#">Last Tournament in Modesto</a></h3>
<p>Although we won excellence in this tournament, our notebook could've used some work. In addition, we realized our strongest 
driver strategy was not to alliance with a strong tray bot, but rather with a stronger tower bot, so that our scoring 
is multiplied, and much more efficient. Other than that, all parts of our robot worked very well, and we look forward to 
adding a tower mechanism in addition to our consistent tray bot.
